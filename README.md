Overview:
The dashboard opens with a high-level overview of total sales across all categories for each year from 2014 to 2019. This section includes a summary of key performance indicators, such as total revenue, average order value, and the number of units sold.

Category-wise Analysis:
The main body of the dashboard is divided into sections for furniture, office supplies, and technology. Each section includes separate pivot tables and charts that break down sales data by category. These tables and charts display information such as total sales, top-selling products, and sales distribution.

Yearly Comparison:
A pivot table with a yearly comparison is integrated into the dashboard. This table allows users to see the percentage growth or decline in sales for each category from 2014 to 2019. The information is presented both numerically and visually through a pivot chart, making it easy to identify trends and patterns.

Top Performing Products:
For each category, a section is dedicated to showcasing the top-performing products based on sales volume. This information is displayed in a pivot table, allowing users to quickly identify the most popular items in each category over the specified time frame.

Geographical Analysis:
If applicable, the dashboard may include a geographic analysis section. This could consist of pivot tables and charts showing sales performance in different regions or countries. This allows for targeted decision-making based on regional trends and preferences.

Filtering Options:
The use of filters in the dashboard provides interactivity, allowing users to customize their view. Filters may include options to select specific categories, time frames, or even individual products. This feature enhances the dashboard's flexibility and usability.

Visual Enhancements:
The use of vibrant and contrasting colors, as well as visually appealing charts, makes the dashboard easy to understand at a glance. Well-designed data visualizations can effectively convey complex information in a simple and digestible format.
